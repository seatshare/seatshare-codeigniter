There are three main ways to contribute to the development of SeatShare.

### Feature Development

Releasing new features that improves our users' satisfaction with the platform.

### Bug Fixes

As bugs are encountered and reported, submit patches to address them.

### Documentation

Both technical documentation ("How do I get this up and running on a new server?") and user facing documentation ("How do I rename my group?") are both important.
